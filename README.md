# Hello, World! ;)
### I am a Python programmer with a focus on system security, CLI development, and penetration testing.
---
I am working with Python and C programming languages in CLI development, cybersecurity, and penetration testing.

I have completed online courses in programming, pentesting, and cybersecurity through Udemy and Harvard University's CS50 program and I have over 10 years of experience in the field of computer technologies, programming, and cybersecurity. I'm now focused on applying my skills to real-world projects and collaborating with others in the cybersecurity community.

I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to cybersecurity and pentesting initiatives. I'm also open to feedback on my code and learning from others in the community.
